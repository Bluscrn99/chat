## demo chat app
an extremely simple chat app just to learn about websockets and maybe i will use it somewhere. will expand on this..?
### usage
fire up server.js using node.js
then, open the client (index.html) from the client folder
wait for connection. dont worry about setting the ip in the client as by default it's your local machine.
the chat should be working, get another client open to test it out
